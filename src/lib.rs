//! # High-level bindings to quickjs
//!
//! The `rquickjs` crate provides safe high-level bindings to the [quickjs](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) javascript engine.
//! This crate is heavily inspired by the [rlua](https://crates.io/crates/rlua) crate.
//!
//! # The `Runtime` and `Context` objects
//!
//! The main entry point of this library is the [`Runtime`] struct.
//! It represents the interperter state and is used to create [`Context`]
//! objects. As the quickjs library does not support threading the runtime is locked behind a
//! mutex. Multiple threads cannot run as script or create objects from the same runtime at the
//! same time.
//! The [`Context`] object represents a global environment. Contexts of the same runtime
//! can share javascript objects like in browser between frames of the same origin.
//!
//! # Converting Values
//!
//! This library has multiple traits for converting to and from javascript.
//! The [`IntoJs`] trait is used for taking rust values and turning them into javascript values.
//! The [`FromJs`] is for converting javascript value to rust.
//! Note that this trait does not automatic coercion but the [`Coerced`] can be used to convert
//! the values with coercion.
//!
//! For values which represent the name of variables or indecies the
//! trait [`IntoAtom`] is available to convert values to the represention
//! quickjs requires.
//!
//! # Optional features
//!
//! ## Default
//!
//! This crate can be customized via features. The following features is enabled by default but can be disabled when not needed:
//! - `classes` enables support for ES6 classes. Any user-defined Rust type can be exported to JS as an ES6 class which can be derived and extended by JS.
//! - `properties` enables support for object properties (`Object.defineProperty`).
//! - `exports` adds an ability to read the module exports.
//!
//! ## Advanced
//!
//! The following features may be enabled to get an extra functionality:
//! - `allocator` adds support for custom allocators for [`Runtime`]. The allocators should implements [`Allocator`] trait and can be plugged on [`Runtime`] creation via [`Runtime::new_with_alloc`].
//! - `rust-alloc` forces using Rust's global allocator by default instead of libc's one.
//! - `loader` adds support for custom ES6 modules resolvers and loaders. The resolvers and loaders should implements [`Resolver`] and [`Loader`] traits respectively and can be plugged in already existing [`Runtime`] before loading modules via [`Runtime::set_loader`]. The resolvers and loaders can be easily combined via tuples. When the previous resolver or loader failed the next one will be applied.
//! - `dyn-load` adds support for loadable native modules (so/dll/dylib).
//! - `array-buffer` adds support for [`ArrayBuffer`] and [`TypedArray`].
//! - `futures` adds support for async Rust. When enabled the Rust futures can be passed to JS as [ES6 Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and ES6 Promises can be given back as Rust futures.
//! - `tokio` adds integration with [`tokio`] async runtime. The method [`Runtime::spawn_executor`] can be used with [`Tokio`] to spawn async executor.
//! - `async-std` adds integration with [`async_std`] runtime. The method [`Runtime::spawn_executor`] can be used with [`AsyncStd`] to spawn async executor.
//! - `smol` adds integrations with [`smol`] async runtime. The method [`Runtime::spawn_executor`] can be used with [`Smol`] to spawn async executor.
//! - `macro` enables some useful procedural macros which gets Rust/JS interop much easy. An [attribute](#attributes) macros can be applied to functions, constants and modules. An [derive](#derives) macros can be used with structs and enums.
//! - `phf` enables using Perfect Hash Function for builtin modules lookup
//!
//! ## Custom
//!
//! To gets build faster the numbers of arguments which can be passed to and given by the functions is limited to 6. If you need more arguments you can enabled feature `max-args-N` where N is number from 7 to 16.
//!
//! ## Extra types
//!
//! This crate has support for conversion of many Rust types like [`Option`](std::option::Option), [`Result`](std::result::Result), [`Vec`] and other collections. In addition an extra types support can be enabled via features:
//! - `either` adds [`FromJs`]/[`IntoJs`] implementations for [`Either`](`either::Either`)
//! - `indexmap` adds [`FromJs`]/[`IntoJs`] implementations for [`IndexSet`](`indexmap::IndexSet`) and [`IndexMap`](`indexmap_rs::IndexMap`)
//!
//! ## Bindings
//!
//! The bindings is pre-built for the following platforms:
//! - `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
//! - `x86_64-apple-darwin`
//! - `i686-pc-windows-gnu`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, `i686-pc-windows-msvc`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
//!
//! To build the crate for unsupported target you must enable `bindgen` feature.
//!
//! ## Experimental
//!
//! - `parallel` enables multithreading support.
//!
//! Note that the experimental features which may not works as expected. Use it for your own risk.
//!
//! ## Debugging
//!
//! QuickJS can be configured to output some info which can help debug. The following features enables that:
//! - `dump-bytecode`
//! - `dump-gc`
//! - `dump-gc-free`
//! - `dump-free`
//! - `dump-leaks`
//! - `dump-mem`
//! - `dump-objects`
//! - `dump-atoms`
//! - `dump-shapes`
//! - `dump-module-resolve`
//! - `dump-promise`
//! - `dump-read-object`
